# Marta_eDNA_QUBIT
Qubit data from Tonga eDNA.
This Quibit data is the initial step to determine the validity of the eDNA samples colected from coral heads habitats and coral rubble habitat: 1. for presence of DNA from a given amount of filtered water collected from the habitats, and
2. for presence of Cryptobenthic reef fishes (this will be possible when sequencing data becomes available).

The Qubit machine detects minutes amount of DNA present in the samples that have undergone the extraction process. This dataset is just at step  one in the process. 
An interesting question to exlore with this Qubit data is how the amounts of DNA detected in the samples differe from each other depending on the type of habitat they were collected from. Do the samples collected from coral heads have larger values than the ones collected from surface?
There are two different amounts of water that were filtered for the samples. Some samples came from a 400 ml volume of water, while others came from only 200 ml of water. It would be interesting to see if the there is a consistently larger amount of DNA in the 400 ml samples as it would be to expect.
