# Marta_eDNA_QUBIT
Qubit data from Tonga eDNA
This Quibit data is the initial step to determine the validity of the eDNA samples colected from coral heads habitats and coral rubble habitat: 1. for presence of DNA from a given amount of filtered water collected from the habitats
2. for presence of Cryptobenthic reef fishes

The Qubit machine detects minutes amount of DNA present in the samples that have undergone the extraction process. This dataset is just at step  one in the process.
